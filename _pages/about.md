I am a PhD student at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bremen, where I work at the intersection of knowledge-based reasoning and robotics.

My main focus is enabling robots to understand and plan their actions through semantic representations and formal logic. Alongside my research, I enjoy building containerized environments that make our tools easier to use and share—such as browser-based robotics labs. This interest extends beyond work: I also self-host various services at home, including a smart home system, a cloud storage, and monitoring tools.

I like working at the interface of abstract reasoning and practical engineering—turning ideas into systems that actually run.
