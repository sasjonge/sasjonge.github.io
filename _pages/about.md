I am an infrastructure and cloud enthusiast with a focus on building reliable, scalable, and secure systems through automation, containerization, and modern infrastructure design. I enjoy creating environments that make complex tools easy to deploy, use, and share—whether in research, industry, or at home.

Previously, I worked as a PhD student and research associate at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bremen, where I explored knowledge-based reasoning and robotics. This experience shaped the way I approach system design—combining abstract reasoning with practical engineering.

Outside of work, I run several self-hosted services, including monitoring systems, a private cloud, and smart home automation.
I like working at the intersection of structured thinking and hands-on implementation—turning ideas into infrastructure that actually runs.
