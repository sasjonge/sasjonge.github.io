Within the scope of my position as a Research Assistant at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence of the University of Bremen, I contributed to the development of the Virtual Research Building (VRB), a platform for containerized, browser-accessible research environments. Further details can be found on the corresponding [VRB website](https://vrb.ease-crc.org/about-vrb/).
