At the IROS 2023 in Detroit, I conducted a tutorial on implementing knowledge representation and reasoning in cognitive robotics. This session, part of a broader teaching module, demonstrated how to develop AI systems that can autonomously perform complex tasks by deconstructing the robot control system. Utilizing Jupyter Notebooks within a Docker environment for accessibility, the tutorial covered the integration of knowledge representation, planning, and simulation, providing a holistic learning experience in cognitive-enabled robotics.
