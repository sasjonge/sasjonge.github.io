The University of Bremen's Institute for Artificial Intelligence (IAI) presented an innovative Virtual Research Building (VRB) for AI-powered and cognition-supported robotics. The VRB integrates resources for the entire research and innovation pipeline, offering comprehensive access to software components, CRAM architecture, and interactive learning materials. It supports dynamic collaboration and open-source contributions through virtual labs and promotes industry partnerships. The VRB aims to enhance the development of deployable robotic agents, providing a sustainable framework for continuous innovation in robotics. 

I presented the knowledge representation and reasoning frameworks of the Virutla Research Building.
