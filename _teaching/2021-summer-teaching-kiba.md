The seminar "AI-based robot control" prepares students for the Bachelor Project "SUTURO" at the University of Bremen. The seminar gives the students a first theoretical and practical insight into the foundations of ai-based robot control. In the seminar I gave lectures and tutorials about knowledge representation and reasoning for robots.
