## Abstract

The notion of preferences plays an important role in many disciplines including service robotics which is concerned with scenarios in which robots interact with humans. These interactions can be favored by robots taking human preferences into account. This raises the issue of how preferences should be represented to support such preference-aware decision making. Several formal accounts for a notion of preferences exist. However, these approaches fall short on defining the nature and structure of the options that a robot has in a given situation. In this work, we thus investigate a formal model of preferences where options are non-atomic entities that are defined by the complex situations they bring about.
