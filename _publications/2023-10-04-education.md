Abstract.  The paper presents a novel cloud-based digital twin learning platform for teaching and training concepts of cognitive robotics. Instead of forcing interested learners or students to install a new operating system and bulky, fragile software onto their personal laptops just to solve tutorials or coding assignments of a single lecture on robotics, it would be beneficial to avoid technical setups and directly dive into the content of cognitive robotics. To achieve this, the authors utilize containerization technologies and Kubernetes to deploy and operate containerized applications, including robotics simulation environments and software collections based on the Robot operating System (ROS). The web-based Integrated Development Environment JupyterLab is integrated with RvizWeb and XPRA to provide real-time visualization of sensor data and robot behavior in a user-friendly environment for interacting with robotics software. The paper also discusses the application of the platform in teaching Knowledge Representation, Reasoning, Acquisition and Retrieval, and Task-Executives. The authors conclude that the proposed platform is a valuable tool for education and research in cognitive robotics, and that it has the potential to democratize access to these fields. The platform has already been successfully employed in various academic courses, demonstrating its effectiveness in fostering knowledge and skill development.
