## Abstract

We revisit the technique for partitioning ontologies using E-connections
introduced by Cuenca Grau et al. (2006). We extend the underlying notions of
E-connections and partitionings to the latest OWL 2 ontology language, with the
exception of the universal role, which cannot be accommodated for reasons that we
explain. Besides presenting a simplified notation for the theoretical foundations,
we devise a new algorithm for computing partitions which, in contrast to the original quadratic-time algorithm, can be implemented in linear time, is deterministic,
and admits simple rigorous correctness and maximality proofs. We further discuss
possible extensions beyond OWL.
