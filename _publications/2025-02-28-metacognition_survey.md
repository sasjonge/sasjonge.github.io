## Abstract

**Background**: Metacognition has gained significant attention for its potential to enhance
autonomy and adaptability of artificial agents but remains a fragmented field: diverse
theories, terminologies, and design choices have led to disjointed developments and
limited comparability across systems. Existing overviews remain at a conceptual level that
is undiscerning to the underlying algorithms, representations, and their respective success.
**Methods**: We address this gap by performing an explorative systematic review. Reports
were included if they described techniques enabling Computational Metacognitive Ar-
chitectures (CMAs) to model, store, remember, and process their episodic metacognitive
experiences, one of Flavell’s (1979) three foundational components of metacognition.
Searches were conducted in 16 databases, consulted between December 2023 and June
2024. Data were extracted using a 20-item framework considering pertinent aspects.
**Results**: A total of 101 reports on 35 distinct CMAs were included. Our findings show
that metacognitive experiences may boost system performance and explainability, e.g., via
self-repair. However, lack of standardization and limited evaluations may hinder progress:
only 17% of CMAs were quantitatively evaluated regarding this review’s focus, and
significant terminological inconsistency limits cross-architecture synthesis. Systems also
varied widely in memory content, data types, and employed algorithms.
**Discussion**: Limitations include the non-iterative nature of the search query, heteroge-
neous data availability, and an under-representation of emergent, sub-symbolic CMAs.
Future research should focus on standardization and evaluation, e.g., via community-driven
challenges, and on transferring promising principles to emergent architectures.
